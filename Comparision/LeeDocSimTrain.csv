0,"Very few women have been appointed to head independent schools, thwarting efforts to show women as good leaders, according to the Victorian Independent Education Union. Although they make up two-thirds of teaching staff, women hold only one-third of principal positions, the union's general secretary, Tony Keenan, said. He believed some women were reluctant to become principals because of the long hours and the nature of the work. But in other cases they were shut out of the top position because of perceptions about their ability to lead and provide discipline.
