          'Smart ATM Pin Recovery and Secured ATM Transactions Based on Fingerprint Identification':'ATM (Automated Teller Machine) is an electronic telecommunication device that is used to perform financial transaction without need for human clerk or bank teller. ATMs extend traditional banking hours by dispensing cash and making other transaction available 24 hours a day. In ATM machines, the user is identified by inserting an ATM card and authentication is provided by the customer entering a PIN. The PIN provided to the customer is compared with recorded reference PIN number in the bank server. In the existing system, the user has to insert the card and the PIN number. If the PIN is correct, the system allows for the transaction. Otherwise, the system asks for the PIN again and it allows maximum of three times to enter it. After 3 trials the ATM card will get blocked.To reactivate the card user need to visit the bank and do the bank formalities, which is tedious and time consuming job.Biometrics is the science of establishing the identity of an individual based on physical, chemical or behavioral attributes of a person. Fingerprint is a pattern of ridges and valleys on the surface of a fingertip. It often used for biometric identification. Fingerprints are detailed, nearly unique, difficult to alter and durable over the life of an individual. To reactivate that ATM card in the ATM center itself we are using fingerprint biometric.',#2

          'Handbone Age Estimation Using Energy Based Segmentation':'Bones in our body are living tissue. They have their own blood vessels and are made of living cells, which help them to grow and to repair themselves. As well, proteins, minerals and vitamins make up the bone. We are born with about 300 soft bones. During childhood and adolescence, the cartilage grows and is slowly replaced by hard bone. Some of these bones later fuse together, so that the adult skeleton has 206 bones. Bone age is the degree of maturation of a childs bones. As a person grows from fetal life through childhood, puberty, and finishes growth as a young adult, the bones of the skeleton change in size and shape. These changes can be seen by x-ray. The "bone age" of a child is the average age at which children reach this stage of bone maturation. A childs current height and bone age can be used to predict adult height. Bone age x-rays helps to evaluate children for advanced or delayed growth and physical development. The most commonly used method is based on a single x-ray of the left hand, fingers, and wrist. A hand is easily x-rayed with minimal radiation and shows many bones in a single view. The bones in the x-ray are compared to the bones of a standard atlas, usually "Greulich and Pyle".In our proposed method bone age is determined by detailed morphological analyses of left hand x-ray, using discrete wavelet transformation or image transformation, energy based segmentation, Jacobi method, EMROI and CROI for feature extraction, ISEF edge detector and k-mean classifier.',#4

One of the most common biometric techniques is face recognition, since face is the convenient way used by the people to identify each-other. Understanding how humans recognize face sketches drawn by artists is of significant value to both criminal investigators and forensic researchers in Computer Vision. However studies say that hand-drawn face sketches are still very limited in terms of artists and number of sketches because after any incident a forensic artist prepares a victim’s sketches on behalf of the description provided by an eyewitness. Sometimes suspects used special mask to hide some common features of faces like nose, eyes, lips, face-color etc. but the outliner features of face biometrics one could never hide. In this work, I concentrated on some specific facial geometric feature which could be used to calculate some ratio’s of similarities from the template photograph database against the forensic sketches.

We aim to design various systems to achieve the desired operations, which no longer require time-consuming manual switching of the streetlights. The proposed work is accomplished by using an Arduino microcontroller, a light dependent resistor (LDR) and infrared-sensors while, two main contributions are presented in this work. Firstly, we show that the streetlights can be controlled based on the night and object’s detection. In which the streetlights automatically turn to DIM state at night-time and turn to HIGH state on object’s detection, while during day-time the streetlights will remain OFF. Secondly, the proposed automated system is further extended to skip the DIM condition at night time, and streetlights turn ON based on the objects’ detection only. In addition, an automatic door system is introduced to improve the safety measurements, and most importantly, a counter is set that will count the number of objects passed through the road. The proposed systems are designed at lab-scale prototype to experimentally validate the efficiency, reliability, and low-cost of the systems.

          'Image Steganography Using Kmeans & Encryption':'Steganography involves hiding of text, image or any sensitive information inside another image, video or audio in such a way that an attacker will not be able to detect its presence. Steganography is, many times, confused with cryptography as both the techniques are used to secure information. The difference lies in the fact that steganography hides the data so that nothing appears out of ordinary while cryptography encrypts the text, making it difficult for an outsider to infer anything from it even if they do attain the encrypted text. Both of them are combined to increase the security against various malicious attacks. Image Steganography uses an image as the cover media to hide the secret message. In this paper, we propose an image steganography method which clusters the image into various segments and hides data in each of the segment. Various clustering algorithms can be used for image segmentation. Segmentation involves huge set of data in the form of pixels, where each pixel further has three components namely red, green and blue. K-means clustering technique is used to get accurate results. Therefore, we use K-means clustering technique to get accurate results in a small time period.',#88

          'Light Fidelity Data Transmission':'Light-Fidelity is a label for wireless-communication systems using light as a carrier instead of traditional radio Frequencies [1], as in Wi-Fi. Li-Fi has the advantage of being able to be used in sensitive areas such as in Aircraft and other transportation without causing interference. However, the light waves used cannot penetrate walls. It is typically implemented using white LED bulbs at the Downlink transmitter. This type of devices are normally used for illumination only by applying a constant current. However, by fast and subtle variations of the current, the optical output can be made to vary at extremely high speeds. This property of optical current is used in Li-Fi setup. The operational procedure is very simple-, if the LED bulb is on, you transmit a digital 1, if it’s off you transmit a 0. The LEDs can be switched on and off very quickly, which gives nice opportunities for transmitting data. Hence all that is required is some LEDs and a controller that code data into those LEDs. All one has to do is to vary the rate at which the LED’s flicker [2] depending upon the data we want to encode. Further enhancements can be made in this method, like using an array of LEDs for parallel data transmission, or using mixtures of red, green and blue LEDs to alter the light’s frequency with each frequency encoding a different data Channel. Such advancements promise a theoretical speed of 10 Gbps – meaning one can download a full high-definition film in just 30 seconds.',#90

          'Face Detection Using Template Matching':'Face detection is concerned with finding whether or not there are any faces in a given image (usually in gray scale) and, if present, return the image location and content of each face. This is the first step of any fully automatic system that analyzes the information contained in faces (e.g., identity, gender, expression, age, race and pose).While earlier work dealt mainly with upright frontal faces, several systems have been developed that are able to detect faces fairly accurately with in-plane or out-of-plane rotations in real time. Although a face detection module is typically designed to deal with single images, its performance can be further improved if video stream is available.Face detection is the first stage of an automatic face recognition system, since a face has to be located in the input image before it is recognized. A definition of face detection could be: given an image, detect all faces in it (if any) and locate their exact positions and size. Usually, face detection is a twostep procedure: first the whole image is examined to find regions that are identified as ―face‖. After the rough position and size of a face are estimated, a localization procedure follows which provides a more accurate estimation of the exact position and scale of the face. So while face detection is most concerned with roughly finding all the faces in large, complex images, which include many faces and much clutter, localization emphasizes spatial accuracy, usually achieved by accurate detection of facial features. Face-detection algorithms focus on the detection of frontal human faces, whereas newer algorithms attempt to solve the more general and difficult problem of multi-view face detection. That is, the detection of faces that are either rotated along the axis from the face to the observer (in-plane rotation), or rotated along the vertical or left-right axis (out-of-plane rotation), or both. The newer algorithms take into account variations in the image or video by factors such as face appearance, lighting, and pose.',#92
