    'Research is done on keyword extraction based on Word2Vec weighted TextRank':'a research is done on the keyword extraction method of news articles. A candidate keywords graph model is built based on the basic idea of TextRank, use Word2Vec to calculate the similarity between words as transition probability of nodes weight, calculate the word score by iterative method and pick the top N of the candidate keywords as the final results'
    'Similarity Analysis of Law Documents Based on Word2vec':'The similarity analysis of law documents is the basis of intelligent justice, while law documents based on several types of cases are quite different in terms of format and length, which causes trouble in analyzing similarities. For that we propose a more specific approach to dealing with law documents, combining Word2vec with legal documents corpus.'
    'Interpretable Machine Learning in Healthcare through Generalized Additive Model with Pairwise Interactions (GA2M): Predicting Severe Retinopathy of Prematurity':'We have investigated the risk factors that lead to severe retinopathy of prematurity using statistical analysis and logistic regression as a form of generalized additive model (GAM) with pairwise interaction terms (GA2M). In this process, we discuss the trade-off between accuracy and interpretability of these machine learning techniques on clinical data. We also confirm the intuition of expert neonatologists on a few risk factors, such as gender, that were previously deemed as clinically not significant in RoP prediction.'
    'Research on Patent Text Classification Based on Word2Vec and LSTM':'Combined with the features of the patent text, first of all, in the text pre-processing process, words frequently appearing in patent documents such as “the invention”, “involvement”, and “utility model” were added to the stop word list to save storage space and improve efficiency; Secondly, the pre-trained word2vec model was introduced to solve the dimensional disaster caused by the traditional methods. Finally, by training the LSTM classification model, text features were extracted and patent text classification in the security field was performed.'
    'GPS Guided Farm Mapping and Waypoint Tracking Mobile Robotic System':'With the rapid development of automated farm facilities such as auto-weather report, crops growing monitoring,soil testing, animal health tracking, milking etc. a future-focused autonomous real time farm environment monitoring mobile robot platform is in need. Such a system will provide a base for integrating automated farm tools and facilities and maximize the use of modern farm technologies. This research developed an economic GPS guided farm mobile system with the vision for future system expansion. A physical testing model has been built that consists of four major units, i.e. navigation system,communication unit, control system, and mechanical platform. These four units have been successfully integrated as a GPS guided farm mobile robotic system that is capable of mapping and re-tracking field boundaries. It can also be taught by moving the robot around the farm or the perimeter of a paddock to learn the size and shape and gain the environment information for the robot to perform its tasks in later stage. The system provides potentials for further development that could bring more significant contributions to intelligent farming machines and agricultural automation.'
    'Wearable smart health monitoring system for animals':'In today’s scenario, the health of animal has got a lot of concern. To monitor the health of an animal we have to wait for veterinary experts for evaluation and diagnosis. This eventually leads to late treatment and degradation of animal health. Therefore, for primary health diagnosis by the animal owner we have proposed to design a system which tracks the health of an animal. For this we have used sensors such as the temperature, heart rate, the respiratory rate, blood pressure module and electrocardiogram module are used. This can be achieved by developing a system with the sensors which can be mounted on the animal body to get the desired physiological parameters like temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, ECG and Blood pressure. This system will contribute in the novelty and feasibility of health care of animals. Therefore, a suitable wearable health monitoring system for animals is developed.'
    'Improving Search Result Clustering by Enriching Snippets with Word2Vec Model':'Search Result Clustering (SRC) is an approach to solve the problems of web search engines under users broad or ambiguous queries and no clues to find exact information in a long returned list. SRC groups the returned list and outputs a semantic structured organization to help users to find the desired information quickly.In this paper, we propose a new snippet enriching approach throughout word2vec model. The vector representations of words learned by word2vec models have been shown to carry semantic meanings and are useful in various Natural Language Processing(NLP) tasks. We propose to use the top-n similar words in word2vec model to enrich snippets and we still use traditional TF-IDF weights schema to select features. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we design intensive experiments to evaluate new method and baseline methods. The result of the analysis shows that proposed method outperforms baseline approach significantly. '
