            'Efficient Video Classification Using Fewer Frames':'Recently, there has been a lot of interest in building compact models for video classification which have a small memory footprint (< 1 GB) [16].While these models arecompact, they typically operate by repeated application of a small weight matrix to all the frames in a video. For example, recurrent neural network based methods computea hidden state for every frame of the video using a recurrent weight matrix. Similarly, cluster-and-aggregate basedmethods such as NetVLAD have a learnable clustering matrix which is used to assign soft-clusters to every frame inthe video. Since these models look at every frame in thevideo, the number of floating point operations (FLOPs) isstill large even though the memory footprint is small. In thiswork, we focus on building compute-efficient video classification models which process fewer frames and hence haveless number of FLOPs. Similar to memory efficient models, we use the idea of distillation albeit in a different setting. Specifically, in our case, a compute-heavy teacherwhich looks at all the frames in the video is used to train acompute-efficient student which looks at only a small fraction of frames in the video. This is in contrast to a typical memory efficient Teacher-Student setting, wherein boththe teacher and the student look at all the frames in thevideo but the student has fewer parameters. Our work thuscomplements the research on memory efficient video classification. We do an extensive evaluation with three typesof models for video classification, viz., (i) recurrent models(ii) cluster-and-aggregate models and (iii) memory-efficientcluster-and-aggregate models and show that in each ofthese cases, a see-it-all teacher can be used to train a compute efficient see-very-little student. Overall, we show thatthe proposed student network can reduce the inference timeby 30% and the number of FLOPs by approximately 90%with a negligible drop in the performance.'
            'Deep Learning Hyper-Parameter Optimization for Video Analytics in Clouds':'A system to perform video analytics is proposed using a dynamically tuned convolutional network.Videos are fetched from cloud storage, preprocessed, and a model for supporting classification is developed on these video streams using cloud-based infrastructure. A key focus in this paper is on tuning hyper-parameters associated with the deep learning algorithm used to construct the model. We further propose an automatic video object classification pipeline to validate the system.The mathematical model used to support hyper-parameter tuning improves performance of the proposed pipeline, and outcomes of various parameters on system’s performance is compared.Subsequently, the parameters that contribute toward the most optimal performance are selected for the video object classification pipeline. Our experiment-based validation reveals an accuracy and precision of 97% and 96%, respectively. The system proved to be scalable, robust, and customizable for a variety of different applications.'
            'Real-Time Adaptation to Time-Varying Constraints for Medical Video Communications':'The wider adoption of mobile Health (mHealth) video communication systems in standard clinical practice requires realtime control to provide for adequate levels of clinical video quality to support reliable diagnosis. The latter can only be achieved with real-time adaptation to time-varying wireless networks’ state to guarantee clinically acceptable performance throughout the streaming session, while conforming to device capabilities for supporting real-time encoding. We propose an adaptive video encoding framework based on multi-objective optimization that jointly maximizes the encoded video’s quality and encoding rate (in frames per second) while minimizing bitrate demands. For this purpose, we construct a dense encoding space and use linear regression to estimate forward prediction models for quality, bitrate, and computational complexity. The prediction models are then used in an adaptive control framework that can fine-tune video encoding based on real-time constraints. We validate the system using a leave-one-out algorithm applied to ten ultrasound videos of the common carotid artery. The prediction models can estimate Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) quality with a median accuracy error of less than 1%, bitrate demands with deviation error of 10% or less, and encoding frame rate within a 6% margin. Real-time adaptation at a Group of Pictures (GOP) level is demonstrated using the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard. The effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to static, non-adaptive approaches is demonstrated for different modes of operation, achieving significant quality gains, bitrate demands reductions, and performance improvements, in real-life scenarios imposing timevarying constraints. Our approach is generic and should be applicable to other medical video modalities with different applications.'
            'Delay-Aware Fountain Codes for Video Streaming with Optimal Sampling Strategy':'The explosive demand for online video from smart mobile devices poses unprecedented challenges to delivering high quality of experience (QoE) over wireless networks. Streaming highdefinition video with low delay is difficult mainly due to the stochastic nature of wireless channels and the fluctuating videos bit rate. To address this, we propose a novel delay-aware fountain coding (DAF) technique that integrates channel coding and video coding. In this paper, we reveal that the fluctuation of video bit rate can also be exploited to further improve fountain codes for wireless video streaming. Specifically, we develop two coding techniques: the time-based sliding window and the optimal window-wise sampling strategy. By adaptively selecting the window length and optimally adjusting the sampling pattern according to the ongoing video bit rate, the proposed schemes deliver significantly higher video quality than existing schemes, with low delay and constant data rate. To validate our design, we implement the protocols of DAF, DAF-L (a low-complexity version) and the existing delayaware video streaming schemes by streaming H.264/AVC and high efficiency video coding (HEVC) standard videos over an 802.11b network on CORE emulation platform. The results show that the decoding ratio of our scheme is 15% to 100% higher than the state of the art techniques.'
            'Distributed Video Coding With MIMO for Video Wireless Communications':'The research on Distributed Video Coding (DVC) has been increasingly popular in recent times due to its promising features. In video communications over wireless channels, the noise and multipath fading effects have a significant effect on the perceptual video quality. However, it is noted that in all the research literature on DVC, an errorfree ideal communication channel is assumed. In this paper, we take into account the effects of noise and fading in a wireless channel on the performance of a DVC codec with necessary modifications to the decoding algorithm while proposing a multiple-in-multiple-out (MIMO) based diversity scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed DVC system with 2x2 MIMO channel outperformed the state of the art H.264/AVC video codec at channel SNR levels below 16dB under similar conditions. Further, possible enhancements to the MIMO configuration are also discussed in this paper.'
            'About the Possibility of Integrating Information from Satellite Navigation Systems':'— This article presents the options for the integration of secondary navigation information of satellite navigation systems and the results of modeling the possibility of navigation measurements accuracy improvement during integration. Integration options are based on the method of determining the location of a moving object in space by imposing restrictions associated with the dynamic properties of the object. This method is recursive and is based on the use of secondary navigation information and readings of on-board meters of motion parameters, when each navigation measurement predicts the area of the possible location of the object at the time of subsequent navigation measurements. The corrected location of the object is considered to be the intersection of the areas of space of subsequent navigation measurements with the previously predicted areas of space. As a result of integration of navigation information of satellite navigation systems, the frequency of navigation data updates and the accuracy of navigation location of a moving object increase.'
            'An Inner-Product Calculus for Periodic Functions and Curves':'Our motivation is the design of efficient algorithms to process closed curves represented by basis functions or wavelets. To that end, we introduce an inner-product calculus to evaluate correlations and L2 distances between such curves. In particular, we present formulas for the direct and exact evaluation of correlation matrices in the case of closed (i.e., periodic) parametric curves and periodic signals. We give simplifications for practical cases that involve B-splines. To illustrate this approach, we also propose a least-squares approximation scheme that is able to resample curves while minimizing aliasing artifacts. Another application is the exact calculation of the enclosed area.'
